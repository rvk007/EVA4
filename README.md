This repository contains the solutions to the assignments of the **EVA4** course conducted by _The School of AI_.

## Contents

### Session 4

Reaching 99.4% accuracy on the MNIST test dataset with a model having less than 20,000 parameters and has been trained for less than 20 epochs.
To see the code go [here](S4/).

### Session 5

Reaching 99.4% accuracy on the MNIST test dataset with a model having less than 10,000 parameters and has been trained for less than 15 epochs.
To see the code go [here](S5/).

### Session 6

Applying L1 and L2 regularization on the final model trained in Session 5.
To see the code go [here](S6/).

### Session 7 - Assignment 1

Converting the code in Session 6 into a library where every part of the model is stored in a separate file. The main file should just contain the configuration parameters and call the approriate functions to train and test the model.
To see the code go [here](S7_Part1/).

### Session 7 - Assignment 2

Reaching a test accuracy of 80% on CIFAR-10 dataset using advanced convolutions.
To see the code go [here](S7_Part2/).
