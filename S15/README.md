>Deepnet is an open-source library that can be used for solving problems of Computer vision in Deep Learning.

The colab file will help one understand how Deepnet library is useful while training and testing a model. I have also included a jupyter notebook in the Example folder.

## Install Dependencies

Install the required packages  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`


[num_workers : Used to preprocess the batches of data so that the next batch is ready when 
current batch has been finished. But more number of num_workers mean more memory but it 
also helpful to speed up the I/O process.]
