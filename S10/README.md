The model reaches a maximum accuracy of **91.11%** on CIFAR-10 dataset using **ResNet-18** model.

**LR Finder and Reduce LR on Plateau** was implemented for model training.

The model uses the library **TensorNet** to train the model. The library can be installed by running the following command  
`pip install torch-tensornet==0.0.7`
The source code for the library can be found [here](https://github.com/rvk007/TensorNet).
